Here are a few rules and tips that should help writing a
SANE-conformant backend and including it into the SANE package:


GETTING STARTED
---------------

* You will need information about the protocol the scanner (or other image
  application device) is using. The easiest way is to ask the manufacturer
  about it. You should mention that the code will be open-source, however.

* Read the SANE standard.

* One approach is to write a stand-alone scanning program first. Debugging
  this program is usually easier than using the SANE libraries. However, keep
  in mind what you learned from the SANE standard.

* Once your program works basically, insert its functions into a basically
  empty SANE backend. You can get one by removing everything but the SANE
  includes and SANE API function definitions from an existing backend (e.g.
  test.c).

* When you start writing code, please contact the SANE mailing list in
  order to add your backend to the PROJECTS file.

* Keep other users informed about what you did and want to do. This way no
  work is done twice and you may get volunteers for coding or testing.
  Set up a website or at least write to sane-devel.

* When you have a working backend but you don't want to have it included
  in the SANE distribution yet, at least the .desc file can be included
  (see below for details). So people will find a link to your backend at
  the SANE webpage.


PROGRAMMING
-----------

* Please follow the GNU coding standards.  It's clear that the style
  outlined there is nobody's favorite, but it's much easier to
  maintain SANE if everybody follows more or less the same coding
  style.  It also looks more professional.  The GNU standards can be
  found at:

	http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/standards/standards.text

  Note that GNU emacs supports automatic indentation according to this
  standard.  The command "indent -gnu" can be used to reformat
  existing sources according to this standard.

* Please be curteous to programmer's with terminals that are 80
  characters wide.  It's not difficult to avoid long lines, so please
  do so.  Note that in ANSI C you can split long strings into pieces
  separated by white space.  For example,
  "this is an awfully long string" can be written as "this is an "
  "awfully long string".

* Use only ANSI C for your backend.

* Please do not depend on compiler specific features or, if you do, make
  the dependency conditional so other compilers will still be able to
  compile the files.  In particular:

    - do not use C++ style comments (//-line comments)

    - do not declare dynamically sized automatic arrays; instead,
      use alloca() after including "../include/lalloca.h".  For example:

		void
		func (int n)
		{
		  char buf[n];
		}

      should be re-written as:

		#ifdef _AIX
		# include "../include/lalloca.h" /* MUST come first for AIX! */
		#endif

		#include "../include/sane/config.h"
		#include "../include/lalloca.h"
			:
		void
		func (int n)
		{
		  char *buf = alloca (n);
		}
    - Don't use any #pragma directives---they're completely
      compiler-dependent.

* If you use headers or libraries that may not be available on all systems,
  write a check for configure.in and include it conditionally. If your backend
  depends on these libraries or headers, compile the backend only if they are 
  available (see pint for an example).

* Use #include ".../include/sane/..." to inlude the sane header files
  instead of #include <sane/...>. Otherwise problems with different installed
  SANE versions may occur. Also this makes clear that the local files are used.

* Don't forget to #include ".../include/sane/config.h" in your backend before
  any other includes. If you use lalloca.h see above for the correct
  includes.

* Include sanei_backend.h after the other includes.

* It's no longer necessary to #define PATH_MAX (now in sanei_backend.h).
  If you define it, do so *after* the system includes.

* Please use sanei functions whenever possible (e.g. 
  sanei_config_read()). This makes porting to other os/platforms much
  easier. Most of these functions are documented in their respective 
  header files in include/sane/sanei_*.h. For some of them there is also
  documentation in doxygen format: http://sanei.meier-geinitz.de/. These
  HTML pages can be generated by calling "doxygen sanei-doxygen.conf" in
  the doc/ directory.

* Do make sure that your code is byte-order independent.  This is
  particularly important for networking-related code and when dealing
  with non-textual data files.

* Don't use printf, fprintf or perror to output debug or error messages.
  Use the DBG macro instead. If your backend can't detect a scanner for
  whatever reason it shouldn't output anything as long as
  SANE_DEBUG_BACKENDNAME isn't set. So don't use DBG(0, ...) in this case.

* Please do not assume that `size_t' is `unsigned int'.  On some
  systems, it's `unsigned long' and the size of this type may be
  bigger than that of an int (this is true for practially any of the
  64-bit systems).  To print a variable of type size_t portably, cast
  the variable to u_long and print it with the %lu specifier.  E.g.:

	size_t len;

	DBG(3, "len=%lu\n", (u_long) len);

* Don't use exit() in your backend. You will exit the whole program, not only
  your backend.

* If you use wait() or waitpid() in your backend, check its return value. This
  is important, if the status value is checked for e.g. WIFEXITED after the
  call of wait() or waitpid(). Both functions may fail if the frontend already
  did a wait for the children.

* Please try to avoid compilation warnings. At least with "--disable-warnings"
  there shouldn't be warnings when compiling backends. It's not necessary to
  fix every "unused parameter" warning but take care that no warnings pointing
  to really existing problems or abiguities are missed. Some programming
  techniques generating warnings on gcc may lead to errors on other systems.

* To support translation of SANE options, please mark the descriptions (desc)
  and title of options with SANE_I18N(). See po/README for details.


TESTING
-------

* Please test a backend with "scanimage -T" (plus other options,
  as appropriate/necessary) as this will make sure that sane_read()
  always returns the correct amount of data etc.

* You can also test a backend with tstbackend. tstbackend is not
  compiled nor installed by default. To do that, cd into frontend and
  edit the Makefile. Add "tstbackend" to BINPROGS. "tstbackend --help"
  gives a short help.

* Please test a backend not just with scanimage and xscanimage 
  (+ other frontends), but also with saned.  Based on past experience,
  it is often the case that remote scanning can uncover subtle bugs.
  Note that you don't  have to use two different machines to test "remote"
  scanning---you can use one and the same machine to test a backend via saned
  (just be sure to enable the "net" backend in dll.conf and follow the
  steps described in saned(1)).

* Please test on every available platform/os. Even if no scanner is attached
  to this system, test compilation and running scanimage. If you don't have
  access to other platforms, ask sane-devel.

* Please make sure that all global symbols exported from a SANE backend start
  with the prefix "sane" or "sanei" to avoid clashes with exported symbols 
  of other backends. Make sure, the sanei_* symbols are unique, e.g. by using
  sanei_backendname_*.  Only export symbols that are absolutely necessary.
  You can verify this by running GNU "nm" on the static library.  For example:

	nm -g  backend/.libs/libsane-hp.a

  would list all global symbols in the HP backend. 
  "./configure --disable-shared; make; make libcheck" in the sane-backends
  root directory will name all backend libraries, that contain "illegal"
  symbols.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

* Even if you haven't written a man-page for your backend yet, you *must*
  create a .desc file which describes it. Anytime you submit source code for
  your backend, you should include an update to the .desc file which reflects
  the new state of the backend. The .desc files are used to create the HTML
  lists of supported devices.

* The .desc files are located in the directories "doc/descriptions" and
  "doc/descriptions-external" (for included and external backends).

* "doc/descriptions.txt" describes the format of the ".desc" files. There is
  also a template for new .desc files: "template.desc.". The format of the
  files in the two directories is very similar.  If you'd like to try parsing
  your creation to recreate the sane-backends webpages, look at "sane-desc.el"
  and "sane-desc-ext.el" in the tools/ directory or use "make
  sane-backends.html" and "make sane-backends-external.html" in "doc/". It may
  be necessary to adjust the Makefile.

* When your backend is included in the SANE distribution, add an entry to
  doc/sane.man, AUTHORS and sane-backends.lsm. The sane.man entry should point
  to your documentation (man-page, website, readme).  Also move your .desc
  file from "doc/descriptions-external" to "doc/descriptions".

* In your manual page (backend.man), use @LIBDIR@ and the other macros for
  path names to the libraries, config files and documentation. Don't use fixed
  paths as they will be wrong if SANE is installed with a different prefix
  (e.g. /usr instead of /usr/local).

* If you want to include READMEs, HTML files or other documentation, please
  create your own directory (doc/backendname) and store your files in this
  directory. If you only have a manual page a subdirectory isn't necessary.

* Please keep your manpages and .desc files up-to-date especially regarding
  version numbers.

INCLUDING INTO CVS
------------------

* If you want to include you backend into CVS use the latest CVS to make
  patches. Check the mailing list and the TODO list for information about
  bugs to avoid.

* If your backend isn't included yet in the SANE CVS tree, write an email to
  the SANE mailing list (sane-devel) and ask for inclusion. Usually one
  of the developpers will check the backend for common mistakes and test
  compilation. If everything is ok the backend will be added to the CVS tree.
