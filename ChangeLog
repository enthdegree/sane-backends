	  and brightness controls which influence the calibration data provided
	  to the scanner.

2011-03-06 Ilia Sotnikov <hostcc@gmail.com>
	* backend/hp5590.c, backend/hp5590_cmds.{c,h}: in ADF modes the device can
	  scan up to 14", which is usually bigger than what scanner reports back
	  during initialization
	* backend/hp5590.c, backend/hp5590_cmds.{c,h}, backend/hp5590_low.{c,h}:
	  fixed detection of HP4500 devices (tested) and HP5550 (untested) - these
	  devices need no reading USB-in-USB acknowledgement after each command. To
	  achieve that, proto_flags are passed down to low-level functions. These
	  flags are taken from device descriptions
	* backend/hp5590_low.{c,h}: fixed up get_status command - index should
	  be 0x00, not 0x20
	* backend/hp5590.c: bump up the backend version
