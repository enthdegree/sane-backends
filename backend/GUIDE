Here are a few rules that should help writing a SANE-conformant
backend:

* Please make sure that all global symbols exported from a SANE
  backend start with the prefix "sane" or "sanei".  You can
  verify this by running GNU "nm" on the static library.  For
  example:

	nm -g  backend/.libs/libsane-hp.a

  would list all global symbols in the HP backend.

* Please test a backend with "scanimage -T" (plus other options,
  as appropriate/necessary) as this will make sure that sane_read()
  always returns the correct amount of data etc.

* Please test a backend not just with scanimage and xscanimage, but
  also with saned.  Based on past experience, it is often the case
  that remote scanning can uncover subtle bugs.  Note that you don't
  have to use two different machines to test "remote" scanning---you
  can use one and the same machine to test a backend via saned (just
  be sure to enable the "net" backend in dll.conf and follow the
  steps described in saned(1)).

* Please follow the GNU coding standards.  It's clear that the style
  outlined there is nobody's favorite, but it's much easier to
  maintain SANE if everybody follows more or less the same coding
  style.  It also looks more professional.  The GNU standards can be
  found at:

	http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/standards/standards.text

  Note that GNU emacs supports automatic indentation according to this
  standard.  The command "indent -gnu" can be used to reformat
  existing sources according to this standard.

* Please be curteous to programmer's with terminals that are 80
  characters wide.  It's not difficult to avoid long lines, so please
  do so.  Note that in ANSI C you can split long strings into pieces
  separated by white space.  For example,
  "this is an awfully long string" can be written as "this is an "
  "awfully long string".

* Please do not assume that `size_t' is `unsigned int'.  On some
  systems, it's `unsigned long' and the size of this type may be
  bigger than that of an int (this is true for practially any of the
  64-bit systems).  To print a variable of type size_t portably, cast
  the variable to u_long and print it with the %lu specifier.  E.g.:

	size_t len;

	printf ("len=%lu\n", (u_long) len);

* Please do not depend on GNU C specific features or, if you do, make
  the dependency conditional so other compilers will still be able to
  compile the files.  In particular:

	- do not use C++ style comments (//-line comments)

	- do not declare dynamically sized automatic arrays; instead,
	  use alloca() after including <lalloca.h>.  For example:

		void
		func (int n)
		{
		  char buf[n];
		}

	  should be re-written as:

		#ifdef _AIX
		# include <lalloca.h>	/* MUST come first for AIX! */
		#endif

		#include "sane/config.h"
		#include <lalloca.h>
			:
		void
		func (int n)
		{
		  char *buf = alloca (n);
		}

* Use #include ".../include/sane/..." to inlude the sane header files
  instead of #include <sane/...>. Otherwise problems with different installed
  SANE versions may occur.

* Don't forget to #include ".../include/sane/config.h" in your backend before
  any other includes. If you use lalloca.h see above for the correct
  includes.

* Please use sanei functions whenever possible (e.g. 
  sanei_config_read()). This makes porting to other os/platforms much
  easier.

* Don't use any #pragma directives---they're completely
  compiler-dependent.

* Do make sure that your code is byte-order independent.  This is
  particularly important for networking-related code and when dealing
  with non-textual data files.

* Even if you haven't written a man-page for your backend yet, you
  *must* create a .desc file which describes it.  Anytime you submit
  source code for your backend, you should include an update to the
  .desc file which reflects the new state of the backend.

  "template.desc." is a template for new .desc files.  If you'd like
  to try parsing your creation to recreate the sane-backends webpage,
  look at "sane-desc.el" in the tools/ directory.

* When your backend is included in the SANE distribution, add an entry
  to README and sane.lsm. The README entry should point to your 
  documentation (man-page, website, readme).
