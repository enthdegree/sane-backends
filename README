How to configure, build, and install SANE.

Introduction:
=============
SANE stands for Scanner Access Now Easy.
This package contains the SANE libraries (this means backends and
network scanning parts) and the command line frontend scanimage.
You always find the most recent version of SANE on:

  http://www.mostang.com/sane

The source is available via anonymous CVS, hosted by The Hungry
Programmers. Information on the CVS repository is available from
<URL:http://www.student.uit.no/~pere/linux/sane/cvs-server.html>.  The
following will fetch the latests source:

  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.hungry.com:/cvsroot login 
  [password "anoncvs"] 
  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.hungry.com:/cvsroot co sane

There are several graphical frontends available for SANE.
XSane is available on http://www.xsane.org
The graphical frontends that have been included into the sane package up to
version sane-1.0.3 (xscanimage and xcam) have been put into an own package
sane-frontends-1.0.x, this package is available on http://www.mostang.com/sane


Quick install:
==============

./configure
make
make install

man sane

Prerequisites
=============

In order to build SANE, the following tools and libraries are required:

	- GNU make: version 3.70 or newer

	- ANSI C compiler: GNU C (gcc) is recommended for best performance,
	  but any ANSI-compliant compiler should do

Some more libraries are not strictly necessary to compile SANE, but some
functionality may be lost if they are not available:
        
        - libusb (>=0.1.6): For the sm3600 backend. Can also be used for
          other USB backends especially on non-Linux platforms.
        - libjpeg (>=6B): For the dc210, dc240, and gphoto2 backends.
        - libieee1284 (>=0.1.5): For the canon_pp backend.
        - libgphoto2 (>=2.0beta4dev8): For the gphoto2 backend.

SANE should build on most Unix-like systems. Support for OS/2 is also
available. For more details look at the operating system specific README.*
files. For a detailed support matrix, see:

    http://www.mostang.com/sane/sane-support.html

This table may be out of date. Please send any corrections or additions to
sane-devel@mostang.com together with your platform, os and version.

Please check that there aren't any older versions of SANE installed on your
system. Especially if sane-libraries are installed in a different prefix
directory (e.g. /usr/lib) this may cause problems with external
frontends. Please remove these libraries (libsane.*, sane/libsane-*) before
installing this version of SANE.

Configuration
=============

Simply invoke configure in the top-level directory.  Besides the usual GNU
configure options, there are the following SANE specific options:

 --disable-shared
	Don't use shared libraries.  Useful for debugging or when there
	is a problem building shared libraries.  This implicitly turns
	on --disable-dynamic --enable-static as well.

 --disable-dynamic
	Disable dynamic loading of backends (in the dll backend).
	configure normally turns on dynamic loading when it
	can find the appropriate header files and libraries
	(<dlfcn.h> and -dl).

 --enable-static
        Use static libraries (turned off by default).

 --enable-preload
        Preload backends into DLL backend.  This is useful for debugging,
	when dynamic loading is unavailable, or to reduce runtime linking
	overheads.  If dynamic loading or shared libraries are unavailable
	or disabled, this option is turned on automatically.
	
 --enable-scsibuffersize=N 
        Specify the buffer size of the buffer for SCSI commands. The default
	value is 131072 bytes (128 kb). This may be changed at runtime by
	setting	the environment variable SANE_SG_BUFFERSIZE to the desired
	value. The option is Linux-only at this time.
	--enable-scsibuffersize and SANE_SG_BUFFERSIZE have no effect for
	the Mustek, Umax and Sharp backends. For these backends, the buffer
	size is set automatically and/or can be specified in the backend's
	configuration file. Please refer to the backend's man pages for
	details.

--enable-translations
        Enable installation of backend options. Frontends can use these
        translations for localized option titles and descriptions. GNU
        gettext is necessary. This feature is isn't tested very well and
        thus disabled by default. See po/README for details.

In addition to these configuration options, there are some more SANE-specific
options and many standard-options.  To get a description of available options,
invoke configure with option --help.

If you plan on debugging one of the SANE programs, we recommend to run
configure like this:

   CFLAGS="-g -O -Wall" ./configure --disable-shared

For operating system specific information, look at the README.* files.


Build
=====

To build SANE, simply type "make" in the top-level directory.

To clean up the executables and libraries in the source directory, type "make
clean". To restore everything to the status after unpacking the package, type
"make distclean".


Installation and Configuration
==============================

Once the build has finished, install SANE with "make install".  By
default, this will place the SANE libraries in /usr/local/lib/, the
configuration files in /usr/local/etc/sane.d/, and the manual pages in
/usr/local/man/.  The location of these directories can be overridden
with configure options; see "configure --help" for details.

Before running any SANE program, read the PROBLEMS file in this directory.

For information on configuring and trouble-shooting the various SANE
components, please refer to the manual page sane(7).

The tools directory contains some small programs that may be helpfull. They
are described in tools/README.

Removing
========

Type "make uninstall" to remove SANE from your system. This will also remove
older versions of SANE if they have been installed at the same prefix.
Warning: Your configuration will be deleted also so make sure you have a
backup. By default the configuration files are located in
the directory /usr/local/etc/sane.d/.
